> A scoring app for the card game 400 or arba3meyeh.

So I have got this mate who recons he is the best at 400 ever... He recounts stories of calling 10 and making it multiple times when no one else can remember. Anyway, this will be our place to keep our games logged. Stats will be collated and games can be reported on. I am working on building all this functionality into the app. I am happy for anyone else to score their games using the app too.

Once I get the app up and running completely, I will post a proper `readme` here with information and help.

# Current Activities

- [ ] build the ui to show a runsheet of the game scores
- [ ] refactor the call & make/results jsx files into one
- [ ] build a dedicated ui to spectate (for other players to load on their device)
- [ ] build some output stats post-match, just general interest stuff
- [ ] build a way to email those stats to players
- [ ] setup an account system to let players login and keep their games together

# Warnings

Please note that until specifically stated - don't assume your games will stay online.
